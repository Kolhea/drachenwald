---

The Order of the Mark is a Society-wide order, which recognises excellence in the arts of [archery and thrown weapons.]({% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/index.md %})  It is equal in dignity to orders of [Chivalry]({% link peers/chivalry/index.md %}), the [Laurel]({% link peers/laurel/index.md %}), the [Pelican]({% link peers/pelican/index.md %}), and [Defense]({% link peers/defence/index.md %}).

It is a consulting or 'polling' order, meaning that the king and queen choose who to invite to the order, after consulting with the existing members. Typically, this consultation includes a discussion period and a poll. 

The Order is distinct from the [Drachenwald Company of Archers]({% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/index.md %}), although there is naturally considerable overlap between the Captains General of Archers of the Company and the members of the Order of the Mark.  It is worth remembering that the Company is Drachenwald institution, and advancement is administered internally, while the Order of the Mark is recognized throughout the SCA, and members are elevated by the Crown.
