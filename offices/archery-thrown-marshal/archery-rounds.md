# Drachenwald round

The Drachenwald round was devised to provide a more authentic standard competition for the Kingdom. This competition rewards both shooting skill and the use of authentic equipment. It consists of three parts.

## Clout Shoot
This is a long range, timed round which simulates military field archery. Arrows are shot into the target that represents a besieged castle or an element of enemy soldiers arrayed for battle. 

* The target is a circle ten yards in **diameter** (Radius of five yards), marked on the ground. It can be made of hay bales or other suitable materials
* Distance  from the shooting line to the closest part of the target circle is one hundred yards (100yd)
* This is a one minute (sixty second) timed shoot with unlimited arrows
* Arrows that fall within the circle score two points
* An archer releasing an arrow before the start, or after the end, of the sixty second period will lose a scoring arrow from their total
* Competition distances for children. The age of the child is counted as of the *start* of any competition
  * Under thirteen (13) years of age will shoot from a line sixty yards from the closest part of the target
  * Under ten (10) years of age will shoot from a line forty yards from the closest part of the target

In the case where there is not sufficient space for a one hundred yard distance between shooting line and the boundary of the circle, the distance may be reduced down to a minumum of eighty yards. When reducing the distance, the **diameter** of the circle must be proportionately reduced to a minimum of eight yards.

## Shooting at the mark
This is a short-range round, based on precision, having more in common with hunting than with military archery.  

* The target is a piece of plain paper, 21cm x 21cm (8¼" x 8¼")
  * An A4 sheet of paper is 21cm wide, so if you can cut it so it is square, that is a relatively easy way to create the target.
* The paper may be oriented on the target any way you like
* The shoot consists of three ends
  * One round of six arrows at forty yards with no time limit
  * One round of six arrows at thirty yards with no time limit
  * One round of six arrows at twenty yards with no time limit
* Each arrow that hits the mark scores two points. This yields a maximum of thirty six points.
* Competition distances for children. The age of the child is counted as of the *start* of any competition
  * Under thirteen (13) years of age
    * Thirty, twenty, and ten yards
  * Under ten (10) years of age
    * Twenty, fifteen, and ten yards
   
## Authenticity
Using, and making, authentic equipment may also yield points for an archer. A maximum of nine points may be gained without loosing an arrow
   * Three points are awarded to archers shooting a medieval bow design
     * An English longbow (D shaped without a sight window)
     * A self bow
     * A bow which can be documented as more medieval than a modern recurve or fibreglass laminated longbow
   * Three points are awarded for using arrows with self nocks
   * Three points are awarded to all archers who either
     * Have built their own bow themselves OR
     * Have built their own period-style arrows (with self nocks and tied-on feathers)
