## Rules for Drachenwald Fall Crown Tournament 2025

In all bouts the fighter may use any weapon in which she or he is authorized.

All fighters will fight in a round-robin. Each match will be fought best two out of three bouts. Double kills will be counted as a loss for both fighters and will not be refought. If after three bouts there is no clear winner both fighters will be considered to have lost that match.

In the case of an uneven number of fighters there may be a non-destructive byfighter.

If a fighter has to drop out of the tournament before the round-robin is concluded, all the results they have so far will be disregarded, both for the fighter dropping out and all of their opponents.

After the round-robin is concluded, if there are four fighters with more points than the others, they will qualify for the semifinals. In case of ties, the places in the semifinal will be determined either by a single bout between those with the least points or a mini round-robin. Double kills will be refought. Any fighter with higher scores will earn their place in the semifinals without fighting for it.

### SEMIFINALS

The four fighters who qualified for the semifinals will be randomly paired. Semifinals will be fought best out of three. Double kills will not be refought. If any fighter has more points than the other after three bouts they are qualified for the finals. If not, fighting will continue one bout at a time until that is the case.

### FINALS

Finals will be fought best out of five. Double kills will not be refought. If any fighter has more points than the other after five bouts they shall be declared the winner. If not, fighting will continue one bout at a time until that is the case.
